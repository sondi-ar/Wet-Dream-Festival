      <h2>The difficult search for actors for the porn film ›Colt & Köcher</h2>
      <p>I was constantly trying to raise the standard, my next plan was to shoot a film outside.
         Uve Schmidt and I developed a scenario called 'Colt & Köcher',
         the message was that a couple of trappers were exploiting an Indian couple: 'Colt und Köcher oder Die Ausbeutung' or
         'how the west was won'. An Indian couple is caught by the trapper couple. In this scenarion the exploitation equals sexual exploitation.
         As an Indian, we had Fatima Igrahim in mind, who at that time celebrated the happy early life in Frankfurt.
         With an estimated seventeen under influence of Bernd Malzahn from Hilden alias Brummbär and with the help of a waterbed, she had stylized herself as the original cell of all female liberation pornography.
         The simple dramaturgical means of the silent film were intended to achieve the highest level of action and erotic fascination.</p>

  As an Indian, we had Fatima Igrahim in mind, who at that time celebrated the happy early life in Frankfurt as Diddiewadidd. With an estimated seventeen under influence of Bernd Malzahn from Hilden alias Brummbär and with the help of a waterbed, she had stylized herself as the original cell of all female liberation pornography. No, not just hip porn model, imagine that she also sang, then you would have had something like Madonna in Hessen. Fatima was available because she had just had a good time with Abi Melzer, because Gunter Rambow had just photographed her for Abi Melzer's ›Softgirls‹ together with Rosy Rosy. This book became a bestseller, after which Fatima felt shitty by Abi and changed the fronts, ran over to Olympia Film.

So Fatima as an Indian. After the second film, we started a portfolio of porn models that grew very slowly, there were never more than twenty-five cards. Uve Schmidt, however, devotedly led her with due regard to sexual preferences and inhibitions. Günter Amendt proposed to us as Indians the bisexual Thomas from Berlin, a ›Sexfront‹ employee and member of the burgeoning city Indian scene. Yes, it was an Indian film through and through. And just like the wolf in history, Thomas had a friend, Thodora Osikowska, who was also on Amendt's “Sexfront” list of employees, who, as a Berlin city native, was actually not designed to be a trapper. The intended trapper came from Uve Schmidt's cast file and, cursed, failed the day before shooting started. After all, new actors should be presented in every film, so that there are no signs of fatigue among consumers. Also because of the location outside and the other preparations, the appointment could not be postponed. We had finally found an undisturbed, idyllic location in one of the forests surrounding Frankfurt with the help of the crazy banker Lindemann, who was our chief accountant for a short time. He had actually been a banker and became one after I kicked him out. The story of my three accountants Rische, Lindemann and Beutter leads to abysses, now we are in the forest. Lindemann wore the golden hunter badge on his lapel, I go through the bookkeeping and say: "Mr. Lindemann, you are a hunter, where is there a forest, where you ...? We need a place where you could play an erotic scene. ”He knew we were making porn films. "No problem, I have a hunting friend, with whom I share a hunting ground in Vogelsberg. You can have the Druschel hunting lodge, you can shoot as long as you want, no one disturbs you there." Wonderful, we had the filming location of the bank director Lindemann, a guy with good connections and an opaque military past. He laced strangely while walking and answered the phone with "Lünnemann". He gave me a hunting supervisor to turn to. By the way, ›Vogelsberg‹ was an unknown landscape for me at the time, like everyone who heard the word for the first time, I thought of a mountain called Vogelsberg. It was not clear to me that it was a whole landscape, a huge extinct volcano, the size of the entire Rhön.

The film staff had already arrived the day before: Rainer Boldt: camera, Wietz: camera assistant, Ms. Löffelholz, then Franz Mons' wife, was engaged as a still photographer, we needed pictures for advertising. In spite of all efforts to open a trapper, I finally said, exasperated: "Let's see what we do tomorrow, maybe we'll change the script, just make another film." But I was queasy, all scenarios were from the later ones Reviewers audited by Marc Adrian, Bazon Brock, Peter Gorsen. Yes, if I am not mistaken, Gorsen gave an opinion for Colt and Köcher, because there was always a need to take the requirements of the art reservation into account. What should we do, make a slightly different, comic film with two women and one man?

I went out in the evening, fell into a bar, drank with a strange blonde animator, pretty, but a bit rough-boned, she was amazingly intelligent. I ended up with her in a séparée, the usual griffin and genéppe. She said that she was studying veterinary medicine in Berlin, was in transit and was completely burned down, so I worked a little here, that her boyfriend was sitting at the main station with a boxer dog in a VW and was waiting for her until four in the morning. "Bring your friend over here, we'll send a taxi over there to come with his boxer and we'll have a drink together." Well, but her boyfriend is gay. So much the better, I thought, then I can fuck with you. And as is often the case, everything works wonderfully in the most absurd constellations. You only have to say to a taxi driver: "Here you have a fifty, look for a guy who sits at the main station in a VW with a boxer, and bring him here." Tuck, tuck, with a chicken nod, rubber cervical vertebrae, when a handsome boy, who is no longer young, comes in, looks like the priest from the 'Thornbirds', so not sixteen or eighteen anymore, but around twenty-eight. My God, even the most masculine gays peep a little, when they are among themselves, sometimes fall into this sonic tone, but there are also natural peeps, one of which was our Jürgen. He sat at the table insulted because Franziska had kept him waiting in the car with the poor dog for so long. Although he knew she had to buy. He was always a little bit snapped, this constantly slightly offended fagot. I had a severe blow to him, he turned me on. I thought maybe he was a guy for the trapper. »How is it, we are going to make a porn movie tomorrow. You're gay, but could you too? "" Oh, that's not a problem at all, I just have to imagine, I'll do it with you. "I was satisfied in my tran that I met the two, the vet and Jürgen. We put another bottle of champagne in to celebrate our encounter, then I realized why she was a veterinarian in the half-world: she gambled, knew a lot about the Berlin gamblers, with the Persian pimps and was also still depending on her professor, who had a relationship with her as a villain and psychosado.

Of course Franziska also wanted to play in ›Colt und Köcher‹. “No, we only need a male actor. In the next film, if you want. ”We drove to the airport hotel, after all Jürgen was now entitled to adequate accommodation. I accompanied the two to their hotel room. Franziska was weird, namely keen on Jürgen, absolutely wanted to sleep with him once, but he didn't want her, but I did with her. "Listen, Jürgen," I said to him, "you have to show it, if you don't bring it, you can't play in my film." First I slept with Franziska, and Jürgen jerked next to us, then she sat down on him, I was lying next to him, he jerked my cock, and the tears rolled down his cheek. A freaky morning story, the boxer was also sad on the bed mat and looked at us. But I was also proud of myself, because I had gotten an actor for our film, drove with Jürgen to the Westend, our team was already waiting: Boldt, Wietz, die Löffelholz. Uve Schmidt was still dyeing Fatima Igrahim all over with a self-tanning sunscreen. The filmmakers were not satisfied with this, not red enough, they said.

Thodora, the trapper, was at the hairdresser on the corner of Mendelssohn- and Schwindtstrasse, he was hairdressing her a reddish-blonde O'Hara hairstyle, blown away by the wind, and of course a wig as well, directed her towards the western carnation. The costume didn't suit the trapper; in the 'clothes' we found a wickedly expensive green fringe jacket made of suede. Jürgen fell in love with the jacket so much that he decided to use it as an additional luggage. "All right, fine, but don't tell the others." We drove back to the company, I went to the accounting department with my star to have Mr. Lindemann pay him an advance. Now it suddenly turned out that this accountant was also gay, I hadn't noticed until that moment. He was still an old type of homosexual camouflaging, but with the tuck at my side there was no stopping him. I hurried in panic through the office to Uve's office, Jürgen behind me, pointed at me. I didn't want to know anything about him. The morning bed scene in the hotel had happened, in which all sorts of things had been mixed and turned, but for me that was primarily a matter of Franziska. He was after me and Lindemann was after him - like in the story of the goose with the golden feathers.
