        <h2>The difficult search for actors <br>for the porn film <em>Colt & Köcher</em></h2>
        </div>

      <p>I was constantly trying to raise the standard, my next plan was to shoot a film outside.
         Uve Schmidt and I developed a scenario called 'Colt & Köcher',
         the message was that a couple of trappers were exploiting an Indian couple: 'Colt und Köcher oder Die Ausbeutung' or
         'how the west was won'. An Indian couple is caught by the trapper couple. In this scenarion the exploitation equals sexual exploitation.
         As an Indian, we had Fatima Igrahim in mind, who at that time celebrated the happy early life in Frankfurt.
         With an estimated seventeen under influence of Bernd Malzahn from Hilden alias Brummbär and with the help of a waterbed, she had stylized herself as the original cell of all female liberation pornography.
         The simple dramaturgical means of the silent film were intended to achieve the highest level of action and erotic fascination.</p>
         <p>
           As an Indian, we had Fatima Igrahim in mind, who at that time celebrated the happy early life in Frankfurt
            as Diddiewadidd. It is estimated that she was only 17 when, under the influence of Bernd Malzahn from Hilden alias Brummbär, and with the help of a waterbed,
            she stylized herself as the original cell of all female liberation pornography.
             She was not only a hip porn model, she could also sing. </p>

<p>So Fatima as an Indian. After the second film, we started a portfolio of porn models that grew very slowly, there were never more than twenty-five cards.
  Günter Amendt proposed to us as Indians the bisexual Thomas from Berlin, a <em>Sexfront </em> employee and member of the burgeoning city Indian scene.
  Yes, it was an Indian film through and through. And just like the wolf in history, Thomas had a friend, Thodora Osikowska, who was also on Amendt's <em>Sexfront</em> list of employees, who, as a Berlin city native, was actually not designed to be a trapper.
   The intended trapper came from Uve Schmidt's cast file and, cursed, failed the day before shooting started.
   After all, new actors should be presented in every film, so that there are no signs of fatigue among consumers.
   Also because of the location outside and the other preparations, the appointment could not be postponed.
   We had finally found an undisturbed, idyllic location in one of the forests surrounding Frankfurt
   with the help of the crazy banker Lindemann, who was our chief accountant for a short time.
   He had actually been a banker and became one again after I kicked him out.
   The story of my three accountants Rische, Lindemann and Beutter leads to abysses, now we are in the forest. </p>

   <p>The film staff had already arrived the day before: Rainer Boldt: camera, Wietz: camera assistant, Ms. Löffelholz, then Franz Mons' wife, was engaged as a still photographer, we needed pictures for advertising.
     In spite of all efforts to open a trapper, I finally said, exasperated: "Let's see what we do tomorrow, maybe we'll change the script, just make another film."
     What should we do? make a slightly different comic film with two women and one man? </p>
<p>
I went out in the evening, fell into a bar, drank with a strange blonde animator, pretty, but a bit rough-boned, she was amazingly intelligent.
I ended up with her in a séparée, the usual griffin and genéppe.
She said that she was studying veterinary medicine in Berlin, was in transit and was completely burned down,
 and that her boyfriend was sitting at the main station with a boxer dog in a VW and was waiting for her until four in the morning.
 "Bring your friend over here, we'll send a taxi over there to come with his boxer and we'll have a drink together."
 Well, but her boyfriend is gay. And as is often the case, everything works wonderfully in the most absurd constellations.
 You only have to say to a taxi driver: "Here you have a fifty, look for a guy who sits at the main station in a VW with a boxer,
 and bring him here." </p>

 <p>
When the boy arrived, I saw that he was no longer young, he was looking like the priest from the 'Thornbirds', so not sixteen or eighteen anymore, but around twenty-eight.
I had a severe blow to him, he turned me on. I thought maybe he was a guy for the trapper. "How is it, we are going to make a porn movie tomorrow. You're gay, but could you too?", "Oh, that's not a problem at all, I just have to imagine, I'll do it with you.
"I was happy that I met the two, the vet and Jürgen. We drank another bottle of champagne  to celebrate our encounter. </p>

 <p>
Of course Franziska also wanted to play in <em>Colt und Köcher</em>. “No, we only need a male actor. In the next film, if you want.” We drove to the airport hotel, after all Jürgen was now entitled to adequate accommodation.
 I accompanied the two to their hotel room. Franziska was weird, namely keen on Jürgen, she absolutely wanted to sleep with him at least once, but he didn't want her.
 "Listen, Jürgen," I said to him, "you have to show it, if you don't bring it, you can't play in my film."
 First I slept with Franziska, and Jürgen jerked next to us, then she sat down on him, I was lying next to him, he jerked my cock,
  and the tears rolled down his cheek. A freaky morning story. I was proud of myself, because I had gotten an actor for our film.
